# REALIZA

Inspired by recent thoughts by [Chistopher Butler][0] ([audio][1]) on humans knowingly talking to machines, I remembered the old ELIZA chat bot. I thought it was be a nice opportunity to experiment with Preact/Redux and possibly get some free therapy from a bot.

## Future

- Use the Chrome web audio API to make actual conversation.
    - Store a common state, so the user can flip between spoken word and text.
- Preserve state between sessions.
    - Service workers and a local store?
